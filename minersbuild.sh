# Simple bash script to build and package Decred miner for all the platforms
# we support.
#
# Currently, ccminer cannot be crosscompiled so it must be manually
# built and zipped up on windows.  Also ccminer doesn't build on linux
# on my build machine (jcv) due to some older libs so it must also be done
# manually.  Hopefully both of these can be fixed in the near future.
